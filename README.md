This repository contains work from Stat479 Statistical Data Visualization

In Portfolio 1, you will find visualization work relating to Fantasy Football data, specifically examining the "Expert Consensus Rank"

In Portfolio 4 I created a Shiny App designed to help people looking to bet on football games. The application allows the users to look at different 'favored' teams and analyze how well they perform against various spreads and over/under marks.
